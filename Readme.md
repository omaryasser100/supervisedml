# House Price Prediction - Data Science Project

This project is a complete end-to-end Data Science pipeline for predicting house sale prices. It starts from raw data and proceeds through preprocessing, feature engineering, and will later include model training, evaluation, and comparison of different supervised learning models.

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle's House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess the raw housing data.
- Explore and visualize the features.
- Apply various supervised ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Compare model performance and select the best one for prediction.
